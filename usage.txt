To use you have to initiate Folder with the directory to scan along with the Options.
Configure Options to suit your need:

$options = array(
    'ignoreFolders' => //An array of folders to ignore,
    'ignoreFiles' => //An array of files to ignore(including extension),
    'extensions' => //An array of extension names with the leading ".",
    'whitespace' => //Whether to count blanks lines,
    'comments' => //Whether to count comments,
);

$folder = new Folder('dir', new Option($options));
$folder->init();


Get number of lines of code, blank lines and comments:

$lines = $folder->getLines();
$whitespace = $folder->getWhitespace();
$comments = $folder->getComments();
